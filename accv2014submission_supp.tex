\section{Simulations}


%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{Setup}

Quantitative assessments used atmospheric-science gold standard simulators.
An atmosphere over $8\times8{\rm km}$  was produced using off-the-shelf large eddy simulation (LES), creating clouds between heights of $500{\rm m}$ to $1500{\rm m}$.
Lighting conditions were consistent with Copenhagen (unrelated to the anonymous authors).
Radiative transfer using the discrete ordinate spherical-harmonic method (SHDOM)~\cite{Evans1998} rendered images taken by 100 cameras placed in a $2.5\times 2.5{\rm km}^2$ domain. Recovery simulations used random subsets
of the network, where the whole network is either with or without
a sun blocker. In the LES, a voxel is occupied by cloud if its water-mass parameter is not null. In the recovery, voxel $k$ is classified as cloud if $T_k>0.01$.
We measured the classification error rate, across all voxels.
% Note that the LES example
%details the  water particle distribution and therefore $B$ is calculated
%as the voxels where the water content equals are surpasses some threshold.
%The threshold we used was half the maximal water content in the example.
%Due to this method we don't expect to achieve perfect reconstruction.
The results are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:simulations}.  As expected of space carving,
results improve fast from 2 to 10 cameras. Even when a sun blocker is applied,
the algorithm is able to reconstruct the cloud formation. Then, as expected,
more cameras are needed in order to compensate for the limited view of
each camera. In our setup the cameras observe the clouds only from below. This is the classical limited
angle problem known from visual hull and tomography algorithms. Therefore the reconstruction error does not
converge to zero.
